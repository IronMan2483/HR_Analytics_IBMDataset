# Attrition and Diversity

I used the dataset created by IBM to identify attrition. The dataset is available on Kaggle.

Besides the reasons for attrition (including strategies to reduce the risk), I will also create a notebook about the diversity in this dataset (will follow) to give recommendations for especially the Recruiting process and to increase diversity in the company and departments.
